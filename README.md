ðŸ’» AVL Tree Implementation (Balanced Binary Search Tree)

This repository contains an implementation of an AVL tree (Adelson-Velsky and Landis tree) automatically balances itself after each insertion or deletion to maintain the property that the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one.
 
ðŸ“Ž The key operations on an AVL tree (insert, delete, and search) are efficient and take O(log n) time, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

## Features
- **Insert**: Adds elements to the tree while maintaining the balance.
- **Remove**: Removes an element from the tree and ensures the tree remains balanced.
- **Search**: Searches for an element in the tree.
- **Traversals**: Pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversals to visit all nodes.
- **Rotations**: Left and right rotations to maintain the AVL tree balance factor.
- **Balance Factor**: Automatically balances the tree after insertions and deletions.
